okay, the idea is, what if there was a packages manager that could
clone git repositories into a local directory?
cause that would make things so much eaiser

its gonna act and look like stuff like npm, pnpm and yarn
so its gonna have a package.json kinda file
where you specify what git repos you want, the `as` renameing, and where you want taht repo to
be cloned into
